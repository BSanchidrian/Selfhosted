# Selfhosted

Selfhosted is a collection of Ansible playbooks I personally use to manage my own home server.

I'll add instructions about how to use this later.

<!-- ## Installation

In order to run ansible you need to have it installed first

```bash
export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=$(pwd)/ansible.cfg
``` -->
